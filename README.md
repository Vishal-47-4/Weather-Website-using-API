# Weather-Website-using-API
Developed a dynamic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that fetches real-time weather data from the WeatherAPI.  
Features include current weather details (temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index, and feels-like temperature) and a 10-day weather forecast. 


Implemented dynamic background changes based on weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy) for an immersive user experience.

Designed a responsive and interactive UI with weather icons and hover effects for enhanced usability.
